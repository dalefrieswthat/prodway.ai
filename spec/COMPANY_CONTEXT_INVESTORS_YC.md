# Prodway AI — Company Context (Investors / YC)

Short reference for applications, decks, and investor conversations.

---

## One-liner

**Prodway AI** builds the company-data layer for consulting and service businesses: AI that generates SOWs, fills forms, and handles proposals/contracts so teams scale without scaling headcount.

---

## Problem

- Consulting and service businesses (agencies, DevOps shops, funded startups) drown in **proposals, SOWs, vendor forms, and applications** (YC, RFPs, intake forms).
- Doing this manually doesn't scale; hiring more ops people is expensive and slow.
- Company context (who you are, what you do, one-pagers) is scattered—no single place that powers SOWs, form-fill, and future AI/agents.

---

## Solution

- **SowFlow:** Slack-native SOW generation (`/sow`), DocuSign e-sign, Stripe invoicing. One command → proposal → signature → invoice.
- **FormPilot (planned):** Chrome extension that auto-fills any form with company data (YC applications, vendor forms, RFPs).
- **Moat:** One company profile + context, used by both products and exposed via API so we become the **company-data layer** that agents (OpenClaw, n8n, Zapier) and future tools call. Usage (with consent) improves defaults and creates defensible data.

---

## Market

- **Primary:** Funded startups and service businesses (companies backed by YC, Antler, a16z) that need to scale operations without scaling headcount.
- **Use cases:** Proposals and SOWs (SowFlow today); form-heavy workflows—applications, vendor onboarding, RFPs (FormPilot).

---

## Traction / Status

- **Landing:** prodway.ai live (GitHub Pages).
- **SowFlow:** Marketplace-ready; Slack OAuth, DocuSign + Stripe integrations; deployable to Railway. Add-to-Slack live.
- **FormPilot:** Planned (Chrome extension); FormPilot API and usage DB in place for future extension + integrations.

---

## Why now / Why us

- **AI + workflows:** LLMs make "generate from context" and "fill this form" tractable; distribution is Slack + browser (where work already happens).
- **Integratable by design:** API-first profile/context and usage events position Prodway as infrastructure for agents and automation, not just a single app.
- **Single schema, multiple surfaces:** One company-data layer → Slack, Chrome, future web, and third-party agents. Clear scaling and partnership story.

---

## Moat (for investors)

- **Data:** Central profile + context + usage (with consent) → better AI, vertical defaults, insights ("teams like yours…"). More products and integrators → more valuable store.
- **Integration:** Being the company-data layer for forms and SOWs increases switching cost as more systems and agents depend on us.
