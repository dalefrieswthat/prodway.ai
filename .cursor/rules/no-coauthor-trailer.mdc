# No Co-authored-by Trailer on Commits

When committing in this repo:

- Use only `git commit -m "message"` (or -m with multiple lines).
- Do NOT use --trailer or any Co-authored-by line.
- Do NOT run: git commit --trailer "Co-authored-by: Cursor <cursoragent@cursor.com>" -m "..."

The project owner does not want Cursor or any agent listed as co-author. Plain commits only.
